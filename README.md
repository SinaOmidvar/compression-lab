This project is an interactive exploration and visualization tool for image compression algorithms. It implements both Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) methods, allowing users to adjust compression parameters in real-time. The core feature is a side-by-side comparison view that contrasts the original image with the compressed results, enabling a clear analysis of the trade-offs between compression ratio and image quality.
